### Acknowledgements
This assignment has been updated from the original version written by [Sri and the CS249r Fall 2020 course staff](https://github.com/srivatsankrishnan/cs249-assignment2). This repository is a trimmed version of the original TensorFlow [model repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git). We refactored the repository to include files/scripts needed to complete this module. But please do check the original repository for other awesome projects.
